# Open Knowledge Belgium

Open Knowledge Belgium is an umbrella organisation (non-profit/vzw/asbl) for numerous Open Knowledge initiatives in Belgium. We make knowledge sharing possible and let different organisations and individuals cross-pollinate. Weâ€™re one of the local chapters of the international [Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/) network.
