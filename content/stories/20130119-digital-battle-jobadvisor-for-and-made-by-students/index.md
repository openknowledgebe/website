**History**

During [_Apps For Flanders_](http://appsforflanders.be/ 'Apps For Flanders') organized by OKFN BE, the Flemish Government and others in September 2012 the public employment service opened some of their datasets as a test. During this moment groups of developers tried to find out what’s possible just with a small amount of data. Their feedback resulted in [_the digital battle_](http://www.vdab.be/digitalewedstrijd.shtml), where more data on employment is open for the public.
