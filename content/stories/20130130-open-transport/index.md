We love transport data. Our Open Transport Working Group, [iRail](http://transport.okfn.be 'iRail'), has just netted a front-end engineering contract for [SoLoMIDEM](http://www.iminds.be/nl/onderzoek/overzicht-projecten/p/detail/solomidem-2), a project to develop an identity manager for [iRail.be](http://iRail.be). SoLoMIDEM stands for Social Location Mobile Identity Manager, and is part of an effort to create a privacy aware online identity. You will be able to use any of these services to let people know what you are doing, where you are going and how late your train is going to be. And if you have to wait for your train to arrive, you will be able to look up interesting spots near your location.
