_On Saturday September 21, 2013 creative developers can get their hands on open cultural datasets during the co-creation event Apps for Culture. The day consists of a hackathon and a session of datatalks brought to you by some inspiring people sharing their experience with open data in/and culture. The event is part of the larger opencultuurdata.be campaign, raising awareness about open data in the cultural and heritage sector in Flanders._

## When?

On Saturday the 21st of September 2013: we’ll kick off the day at 10 and plan to end it at 18. By September 1st, you’ll find a detailed programme + timetable on this website.

## Where?

At Vooruit, located in the centre of Ghent. Just follow the directions on the Vooruit website and you’ll get there in no time – on foot, by car or using public transportation.

## What does it cost?

Nothing – it’s all for free! If you register, we’ll even throw in free catering and a goodiebag. So bring your brain, skills, creativity and friends along because all you can do, is win.

## Actually this whole app-developing isn’t really my cup of tea, but I’m curious to see what’s happening. What should I do?

The more, the merrier! Register yourself as a visitor and pop in. We gathered a couple of interesting speakers in the afternoon who will talk about open data in/and culture. After the talks session you’re more than welcome to stay around for the award ceremony and the closing drinks. The timetable of the afternoon programme will be communicated from September 1st on. These people confirmed already: Nico Verplancke (iMinds/VIAA/Krook), Patrick Hochstenbach (University Library UGent), Pieter Colpaert (iMinds/OKFN), Maarten Zeinstra (Kennisland – NL), Mathias Van Compernolle (iDrops/MuseumLAB), …

## So what happens after the 21st?

As a developer or team, your app can win a prize at the end of the day. However, there’s time until the end of the year to finish off your app. In December 2013, we plan a second (closing) event where all apps will be presented and another award ceremony takes place.

_This day is organized by PACKED vzw – Centre of Expertise in Digital Heritage, in cooperation with Open Knowledge Foundation, Creative Commons Belgium and Kunstencentrum Vooruit. Opencultuurdata.be is supported by the Flemish Government._
