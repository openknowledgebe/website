Open Ghent is an event where we invite everyone to the Lakenhal next to the Belfry in Ghent. Join us in this UNESCO World Heritage protected hall and find out how Ghent, which is also home to the headquarters of Open Knowledge Belgium, has been a pioneer in opening up its data and is still innovating the city up to this day. The location for this event is no coincidence as well. Artoria, a company specialised in historical research and concessionaire of the Belfry was one of the partners of open Summer of code 2014. Together with two #oSoc14 students they created an application for the Belfry in Ghent, based on Open Source Augemented Reality engines and available on GitHub. During this event, Artoria wants to test out the application and gather feedback. But that’s not all. The DataTank which is an open source RESTful data management system, presented by the developers of We Open Data, will present the latest update and the features of the system. Come join us at this free event.
