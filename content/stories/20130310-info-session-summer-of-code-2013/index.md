After two successful events in 2011 &amp; 2012 in Ghent, the Summer of Code ‘13 this year will be simultaneously organized in Bruges &amp; Ghent. During three weeks a group of student employees work on innovative software projects which are delivered by companies in the region.

The students work from two central locations, what transfer of knowledge consolidates and provides an extra dose of inspiration.

To the participating companies will be asked to deliver a project and to make a financial contribution of 3,000 euros to support the student employees. As a result, companies will not only have a working proof of concept back. Moreover, they make contacts with a group of skilled and motivated IT students. Since all code is written in an open model, the knowledge and innovation is also accessible.

On Wednesday, March 13<sup>th</sup>, an information session for interested companies to participate will be organized. This will take place in Bruges at Howest – Campus Rijselstraat (Rijselstraat 5, 8200 Bruges).
