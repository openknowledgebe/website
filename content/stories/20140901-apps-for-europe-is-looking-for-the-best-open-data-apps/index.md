With 10 Business Lounges happening throughout Europe this year, [Apps for Europe](http://www.appsforeurope.eu/) is trying to find the best open data applications and startups that Europe has to offer. Open Belgium invites all the Belgian developers, startups and companies that use open data as a recourse to join this competition. You have the chance to win a spot at the International Business Lounge @ Future Everything at Manchester in February 2015. The finalists have the chance to pitch their open data application to a crowd of international investors, open data experts, incubators and more.

##### There are two possible ways to enter the competition.

In Belgium the Local Business Lounge will be hosted in [Transforma BXL](http://www.transformabxl.be/) during [Open Data Brussels](http://www.transformabxl.be/agenda/event/hackathon-open-data-brussels). More information about this business lounge on this blog later this month.

And next year we want a strong Belgian presence at the international Business Lounge as well.
