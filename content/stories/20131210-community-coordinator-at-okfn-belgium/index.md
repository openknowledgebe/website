_[![Pieter-Jan Pauwels](205ed5e.jpg)](http://okfn.be/files/2013/12/205ed5e.jpg)Let me introduce myself. I’m Pieter-Jan and from now on I’m the new community coordinator at the Open Knowledge Foundation Belgium. I’ll be lead on projects such as Data Days, open Summer of code, Apps for Europe, SoLoMIDEM, The Datatank and many other projects. Above all that I’ll be assisting all the volunteers in making OKFN a known organisation within the field and making open data used and useful._

**What does that mean for us?**

Well, starting today you can contact me concerning questions about OKFN Belgium or open data in general. Volunteers and active members can ask for my help with their current projects and challenges.  
And if you’re new to open data I can help you as well. Do you have loads of data that needs to be open, but isn’t? Are you looking for a strategic and executive partner for managing open data? Then you’ve found your guy.

**What do I have to offer?**

In a previous life I was a social media manager in the famous social media agency [Talking Heads](http://www.talkingheads.be/). That’s were I learned to love thinking about how you can put something in the market in a sustainable and structural way. I’ve worked for non-profit organisations, big commercial companies, business to business companies, you name it. Besides that I studied ‘new media &amp; society’ at the university of Ghent where innovation research was at the core of the program. With this background I hope to contribute to the mission of OKFN.

You can contact me through numerous social media channels. Always happy to meet new open data enthousiasts. You can contact me through:
