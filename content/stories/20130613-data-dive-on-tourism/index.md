On July the 4<sup>th </sup> we organize together with [Flanders Tourism](http://www.toerismevlaanderen.be/datadive 'TVL'), [DOK](http://dokgent.be/doktank/ 'DT') and the [City of Ghent ](http://visitgent.be) a Data Dive on tourism to share a number of ideas and to illustrate current projects.

With this Data Dive we bring together data owners (cities, tourist services, counties, â€¦) and interested developers and designers in an informal setting to investigate the growth potential in Flanders. As well we want to make an inventory of upcoming projects with a focus on more and better publishing of data. At the same time we want to frame the needs and wishes of the developer community.

Main aim is a constructive dialogue to see where we can make jumps together with a bunch of various actors**.**
