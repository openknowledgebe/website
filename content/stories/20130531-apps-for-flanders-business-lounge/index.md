During the Open Data Day on the 14th of June, Apps for Flanders takes place at the same venue. During this event, main focus is on the economic value of innovative open data applications .

Apps for Flanders is part of Apps for Europe, a European program established by European Commissioner Neelie Kroes.  
Apps for Europe wants to encourage governments in 10 different EU Member States to open datasets, and in the meanwhile create and stimulate the social and economic impact of open data. In Flanders this story is lead by the Flemish ICT Organisation (V-ICT-OR), the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) and iMinds-Multimedia Lab.

Earlier, successful programming contests took place in Flanders where opened datasets served as the basis for the development of new digital applications. In previous editions participants work with data sets from local and central governments as Ghent, Antwerp and the Flemish government, but also from a thematic perspective, such as geographic information and labor market data.  
During Apps for Flanders, we organize a business lounge, where selected apps and the teams behind it are getting inspired to find out new business models and coached by experts. In the afternoon we have a pitching session where the jury selects the three best apps!

9u30 -9u50: Warming-up: sketch up of the different actors in the open data field (Hans Tubbax – BICC – Thomas More)
