On Saturday, the 2nd of March, Trissen, OKFN and Katholic University of Leuven organize a hackathon for IT students where they build applications that support the daily life of students.

For this event, the initiating people behind [Trissen](http://www.trissen.be 'Trissen') opened their own data. Trissen.be is an information portal for students that serves as a digital one-stop-shop in Leuven.

This [Apps for Students](http://www.appsforstudents.be 'A4Students') code day fits within the [Apps for Europe program](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/apps/projects/factsheet/index.cfm?project_ref=325090), where selected ideas can move on to a competition on European level. As an international umbrella of several hackathons and co-creation events, Apps for Europe is organized by 19 organizations in 10 European countries. Main goal is to strengthen the possibilities of open data into business opportunities.
