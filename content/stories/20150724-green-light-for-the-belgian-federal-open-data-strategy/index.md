When we first read the results of the [2014 Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/place/belgium/), we said we had [big expectations for 2015](http://www.openknowledge.be/2014/12/09/belgium-scores-slightly-higher-on-the-global-open-data-index-big-expectations-for-2015/). We couldn’t be more right: today, the federal ministerial council has, by recommendation of Minister De Croo and Secretary of State Francken, approved [an ambitious federal open data strategy](http://www.decroo.belgium.be/nl/groen-licht-voor-federale-open-data-strategie-overheidsdata-voortaan-vrij-beschikbaar). Open by default: an important step to embed Belgium into the digital global ecosystem.  
The highlights of what has been decided:

- **State owned companies are included**: the same strategy applies to e.g., Proximus, bpost or the Belgian railway company SNCB/NMBS.
- “Comply or explain”: all datasets and finalised documents have to be **opened up by default**. When something is kept private or is available under a [non-open license](http://opendefinition.org), the data owner is obliged to provide an explanation.
- **The default license is** [**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or licenses with no restrictions. This license has proven in the past to be the best open data license. More information on using CC0 for open data [here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_use_for_data).
- Data should be provided in a **machine-readable** fashion. This is great news for app developers, yet it’s even more exciting for developers of machines that automatically discover datasets and are able to reuse datasets without human intervention.
- All government services will have to appoint an **open data champion**, which is the contact point for the datasets within that organisation.

Open Knowledge Belgium, the board and its community members, are unanimous: we couldn’t be more excited. The strategy gives us the needed policy guidelines to build further on a more open Belgium.
