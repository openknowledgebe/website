The Belgian Federal Government is taking the next step to Open Governance in Belgium, which we applaud with great enthusiasm.  
The FOD Economy announced that in February, it will release the data of the ‘Kruispuntbank voor Ondernemingen (KBO)’. The KBO is the register that holds all the identification data of enterprises and companies situated in Belgium. This data was already accessible through their own databank, but in the near future the data itself will be fully released as a part of their open data policies.

In the mean time but you can access a test file by request through <helpdesk.kbo@economie.fgov.be>. The content of this data can be viewed on the [FOD Economy websit](http://economie.fgov.be/nl/ondernemingen/KBO/Pubd/od/)[e](http://economie.fgov.be/nl/ondernemingen/KBO/Pubd/od/) (Dutch only)

The FOD Economy can still use your help concerning the content and form of these open data files, so they can take this into account in the further development. Feedback can be send to <helpdesk.kbo@economie.fgov.be> as well.
