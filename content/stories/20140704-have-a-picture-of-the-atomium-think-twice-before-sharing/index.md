So you have created a nice picture of a panorama in Belgium? Think twice before you share it. Copyright legislation in Belgium doesn’t allow you to share the picture: there is no freedom of panorama. This is why amongst others, if you look at the wikipedia page of the atomium, you will see a picture of the miniature version, not of the real thing.

Is this absurd? Obviously it is. Neelie Kroes however is calling for copyright reform and we wish to support this.
