Hi everyone,

On Monday (the 14th of May) we’re organising an open data discussion with Truvo. Truvo is the company behind the Yellow Pages in Belgium. It’s an interesting opportunity to ask them about their data policy, technicalities, and so on.

The discussion starts at 19:00 in the Gaston Crommenlaan 4 in Ghent (Truvo’s offices). If you would like to be there, please send an e-mail to pieter.colpaert aŧ okfn.org. We already have a good amount of interesting people with various backgrounds, but we still have room for more.

This discussion is “part of” Apps For Flanders. You can find more information on <http://appsforflanders.be>
