It’s time for the second edition of AppLAB.

During this edition the city of Kortrijk is looking for software developers and designers to work in small teams to work on either a mobile or web applications. The goal is not to create fully finished products, but to gather inspiration and work on new concepts. These can be worked out later on and launched so that all end-users can enjoy it. If possible, the city of Kortrijk will provide support for this making this happen.

### Does this edition differ from the last AppLAB?

This edition is all about visualisation and analysis of data. How can we (re)-introduce the city in an attractive and visual way, based on the available datasets. And more importantly, which new insights can these visualisations bring for the city of Kortrijk or its citizens?

Applab itself is organised by the city of Kortrijk, New Media &amp; Communication Technology (NMCT) at Howest college in corporation with Leiedal intercommunal.

The participants can choose their approach, the only condition to be eligible for a price or award is that the application has something to do with the city of Kortrijk.

### Programme

AppLab is taking place on thursday 26th of june 2014 in the city hall of Kortrijk on the ‘Dakcafé’ (entrance via ‘Papenstraat’).
