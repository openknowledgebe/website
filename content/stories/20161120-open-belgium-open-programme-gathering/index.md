**Open Belgium is a yearly community-driven conference on Open Knowledge and Open Data in Belgium. In just one day community members, researchers, industry influencers and government officials come together to discuss various open efforts in Belgium.**

**Next year’s edition – [Open Belgium 2017](http://2017.openbelgium.be/ 'Open Belgium') – will take place on 6th March 2017 in Brussels. As it’s an event for and by the open community, anyone interested in the open movement can help decide what the programme will look like.**

From 26th October until 27th November there is an [Open Call for Presentations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczqvrb6O5CmozvuNmB7o_GcwsmKAX4bX3QgqRXjwhn7ygjXA/viewform 'Open Call for Presentations'), so that everyone willing to give a talk at the conference can submit his or her proposal(s). Thereafter, all submissions will be reviewed and the final programme will be made through an Open Community Gathering and discussion on Thursday 1st December at event space 4041 in Brussels.

Do you want to join the Open Programma Gathering? Simply register [here](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/open-belgium-open-programme-gathering-registration-29524777404).

**Can anyone join this Open Programme Gathering?**

Yes, anyone can, unless those who have submitted a proposal to give a talk in order to avoid conflicts of interests. Besides that, it’s an open gathering and discussion, so feel free to come and join the discussion, even if you’re not yet familiar with open knowledge or open data. Snacks and drinks are on us.

**Good to know prior to the open programme gathering**

This year, we’re turning things around: Open Cities, Smart Data, marking the different ways open knowledge and open data can contribute to smart urban development, the rise of smart applications and the shift from the raising quantity of data to the raising quality of data.

The main focus will be on keynotes and panels, as the location is centered around one big auditorium and two smaller break-out rooms. To raise the quality of the conference, the maximum number of sessions should be limited to 14.

If you reserve your seat as part of the organising committee, you can expect to get a presentation with all proposals in your mailbox soon after the Open Call for Presentations has closed.

**Where to find more information about Open Belgium 2017?**

**What if I can’t make it?**

First of all, that’s a pity. But you want to help organize Open Belgium? We’re very grateful for that: simply select a ‘no seat, but keep me in the loop ticket’ on [the event page](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/open-belgium-open-programme-gathering-registration-29524777404). We’ll come back to you with more offers.

**Where will the open discussion take place?**

At the event space 4041, Ravensteingalerij/Galerie Ravenstein 40-41, Brussels. Right in the middle of the city, literally a few steps away from the Brussels central station.

**Are we only going to talk about the conference programme?**

Of course not, there will be some time left to meet and talk with other open enthuasiasts.

**What can I do for now?**

Think twice and make a choice between either submitting your proposal to give a talk or registering for the open gathering on Thursday 1st December. And yes, spread the word and join the Twitter conversation via #openbelgium.
