In June 2013, a revision of the [Directive](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-legislation-reuse-public-sector-information) has been adopted by the Union legislator. Member States now have 2 years to transpose the provisions of the revised Directive into national law. But what does this mean?

The revised PSI Directive provides a good legal basis to open up more public data.

**New elements**

- A genuine right to reuse by making all content that can be accessed under national access to documents laws reusable
- Lowers the upper ceiling for charges on reuse applicable in standard cases to marginal costs, i.e. the costs incurred by the individual request for reuse (reproduction, provision and dissemination costs); exceptions are allowed in a limited set of cases
- Expands the scope of application of the Directive under certain conditions to certain cultural institutions such as libraries (including university libraries), museums and archives
- Reinforces the obligation to be transparent on conditions and on charges applied to reuse
- Invites Member State to make more documents available in machine-readable and open formats

These different elements are a good legal basis to move towards Open Data and even Linked Data. The Directive will need to be transposed into national law. As Belgium is a federal state and the PSI Directive covers public data from Federal state, Regions, and even Communities, a consistent transposition across these different levels is deemed appropriate.

During the [break-out session on PSI Directives](http://www.datadays.eu/session/psi-directive/) during [OpenBelgium](http://www.datadays.eu/open-belgium/), you will see what the administrations have set up in order to transpose this Directive in time. Are you up for it?
