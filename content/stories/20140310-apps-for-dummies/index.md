Workshop Apps 4 Dummies  
Saturday, 22 March, 2014 – 10:30 to 12:30

Are you a proud citizen or fan of the City of Ghent with lots of ideas for digital applications but no background in programming or application development? This year you can create an app without that technical background. In less than a few hours, you can make a working application based on a few available templates. The applications as a result are simple in use and offer a perfect introduction to app development. The City of Ghent provides the Open Data sets and helps those who are interested in making their own dataset and input it into the application. Afterwards you can download the source code of the application and make adjustments.

**But how?**  
Thanks to the European project ‘[Citadel on the Move](http://www.citadelonthemove.eu/)’, the City of Ghent provides a few simple tools to make an application with ease. You collect the data that you want to visualise in an Excel-File. Next you convert it to the right format with a convertertool. The result can be used in the app-templates that you can see [here](http://demos.citadelonthemove.eu/).

**What can I do?**  
Just like with any other app, the strength of the result is dependent of the data it is based on. That’s why it’s interesting to brainstorm on what you want to make. The possibilities are endless. A playground app for the neighboorhood, a sick-tree spotter, a pub-crawl app, you name it. If you need data from the city of Ghent, [let them know](mailto:estrategie@gent.be) and they’ll help you along. If the data is open, they’ll give to to you in the right format and up to date.

**Interested?**  
The hackathon is on the 22th of March as a part of Apps For Ghent.  
Sign up through Gentinfo (09 210 10 10 of gentinfo@gent.be). Gentinfo is reachable from monday to saturday, from 08:00 to 19:00.
