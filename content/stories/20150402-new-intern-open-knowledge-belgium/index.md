Hi, my ![fotoLinkedIn](fotoLinkedIn-200x300.png)name is Lara, and until June, I’m an intern at Open Knowledge Belgium. That’s pretty exciting, don’t you think? The main project I will be working on is [open Summer of code 2015](2015.summerofcode.be), a 3 week programme where Belgian students create cool and useful stuff for companies during, quite obviously, summer. Other than that, I’ll also be involved in Datawijs and W4P. The first one is a project to get youngsters to know about open data, the latter is a crowdsourcing platform for social innovation.

**Yes, I get that, but who are you?**

At the moment, I’m completing my bachelor’s degree in communication. Which means I have little to no technical skills, so an internship like this is a bit challenging for me. I do, however, have a bit of a geeky side. For a fact, I do know who Zelda is. Or rather, who isn’t.

After reading that, it should come as no surprise to you that I’m quite fond of the internet. That’s why I’ve taken a big interest in online communication and marketing. I’m also intrigued by the great world of data and all its stories. That’s the main reason I’ve picked out this internship. I do not want to become a techwizz, but I do want to learn more about data as a whole, and open data in particular. I believe that understanding the meaning and possibilities of all of this, will make me a better digital marketeer.

**Talk to me**

Even though I won’t be a part of the Open Knowledge-family for that long, it’s always a great idea to meet new people. You can always contact me if you have any questions or remarks about the projects I’m working on. Or if you want to send me some funny cat GIF’s, that’s okay too. You can reach me in the following ways:
