Next saturday on the 8th of March, SITE or ‘Student IT Entrepreneurs’ is organising the second edition of Apps for Students in Leuven. Good news for all hackathon enthousiasts because even non-students can join in on the event this year. And even better, it’s free with lunch, diner, good atmosphere and new experiences guaranteed.

#### The concept

During the hackathon there are 3 tracks that you can join in on with a team of max. 5 members.

- The **Apps4Students** track is based on student data from Trissen or data from the City of Leuven. The format is not specified, you can make either a mobile or web application with these datasets. The data will be provided during the hackathon itself.
- **Apps4Windows** is a track where you can only develop an mobile app for a Windows phone or tablet. On Friday 7 march the data will be released so you can think ahead about a possible concept.
- **Apps4UpNext** is challenging you to develop a mobile Oneclickpay application for families on either Android or iOS. This data is already available upon request.

#### The prizes

Depending on what track you choose you can either win a startup trip to London, tickets for Startup weekend Leuven or TedxHasselt, Beer (yes beer!), a Windows phone and a smartphone of your choosing with a value of 500 euros.

#### Location?

The hackathon is located at the Computer Science Faculity on the KU Leuven University Campus.
