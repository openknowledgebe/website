This is our last blogpost dedicated to the Open Belgium conference on the 17th of February. Here’s a small selection of the pictures that were taken by [Thomas Smolders](http://ljosmyndun.tumblr.com/) during the conference. Thanks again to everyone for your attendance and we do hope to see you again next year.
