    heading: Our volunteers
    body: We have too many volunteers to sum them all up by name but Open Knowledge
      Belgium wouldn't be complete without its passionate volunteers. All of our
      working groups and most of our projects rely on the great work of
      volunteers, and we're greatly thankful for that.
