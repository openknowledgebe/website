Open Knowledge Belgium is an umbrella organisation (non-profit/vzw/asbl) for numerous [Open Knowledge](/) initiatives in Belgium. We’re one of the local chapters of the international [Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/) network. We make knowledge sharing possible and let different organisations and individuals cross-pollinate.

### **Mission and vision**

*Mission:* We want to open up knowledge in Belgium and see it used and useful. We endeavour to achieve this through both a bottom up and community driven way, as well as through working closely together with governments and organisations. We want to connect our four main actors: the community, researchers, governments and industries. Even more, we aspire to let them work together as a whole, instead of separate units.

_Vision:_ A world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few. That’s what we’re going for. We believe that vibrant Open Knowledge commons will empower citizens and enable fair and sustainable societies. We aim to achieve this not only within the Belgian borders but inspire and get inspired by communities all over the world. We keep spreading the power of openness, hoping one day Open Knowledge will be the standard.

**What is Open Knowledge?** \
While knowledge itself is hard to define, we can define when knowledge is open. The Open Definition states the following: “Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it — subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”. This means anyone can use, modify and share knowledge without any legal, social or technical restrictions. The Open Definition determines in a clear way the principles Open Knowledge needs, and what licenses it must fulfill. The entire Open Definition can be looked up here.

**What is Open Data?**

Open data are the building blocks of open knowledge. The key features of open data are:

- Availability and access: Data should be available as a whole, at a  cost no higher than the cost of reproduction, preferably as a free download on the Internet. The work should also be available in an appropriate and modifiable form.
- Use and re-use: The data must be made available under conditions that allow use, re-use and association with other data sets. The data must be machine-readable.
- Universal participation: Everyone must be able to use, re-use and re-distribute the data. There must be no discrimination against any persons or groups. The subsequent use may not be limited to individual areas (e.g. only for educational purposes), nor may certain types of use (e.g. for commercial purposes) be excluded.

There are many kinds of open data that have potential uses and applications, such as geodata, scientific data, transport data, cultural data, financial data, statistics.

Detailed, practical advice on how to open data can be found in the [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/). The handbook deals with legal, social and technical aspects of opening data.

**The state of Open Data in Belgium**

_Federal_

Opening up data is a global phenomenon. Historically, in Belgium, Open Data emerged bottom up. Although the federal government had not one but two portals as early as 2011, not much had happened regarding federal open data in Belgium until 2015. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Digital Agenda Alexander De Croo signed the Open Data Charter and agreed that Belgium needed to catch up regarding open efforts on a federal level. On July 24th 2015,  the federal ministerial council has approved an ambitious federal open data strategy. Through this strategy 'open by default' is the norm and will have an impact on all federal government agencies and institutions. Soon after, a federal Open Data taskforce was created, which relaunched a unified federal open data portal. Unfortunately, the federal open data strategy has so far failed to leave a big impact on the relevant policy domains. The implementation of the guidelines are politically challenging, because the open data strategy transcends the boundaries of the federal public services.

_Regional_

In Flanders, there are various Open Data projects. Several Flemish cities have been organising events and initiatives regarding Open Data. On Open Data Forum, all news and facts regarding Open Data in the Flemish Government can be found.Wallonia is catching up to Flanders at the moment. They have a few first Open Data initiatives, coming from bottom up initiatives as well as within the government. Similar to the Flemish Open Data Forum, there is Digital Wallonia. That’s the Walloon platform for IT initiatives providing an Open Data portal for the Walloon region. And Hackathon e-Gov Wallonia is actively engaging the Walloon community to use Open Data. Brussels is on the rise as well regarding Open Data, they have been opening up datasets on their Brussels city _[portal](http://opendata.brussels.be/)_ and the region now has its own regional portal and other sources such as their mobility website and quite some geodata of the region through their Urbis Solutions platform.
