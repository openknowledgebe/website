Open Knowledge Belgium is an umbrella organisation (non-profit/vzw/asbl) for numerous [Open Knowledge](/) initiatives in Belgium. We’re one of the local chapters of the international [Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/) network. We make knowledge sharing possible and let different organisations and individuals cross-pollinate.

### **Mission and vision**

*Mission:* We want to open up knowledge in Belgium and see it used and useful. We endeavour to achieve this through both a bottom up and community driven way, as well as through working closely together with governments and organisations. We want to connect our four main actors: the community, researchers, governments and industries. Even more, we aspire to let them work together as a whole, instead of separate units.

_Vision:_ A world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few. That’s what we’re going for. We believe that vibrant Open Knowledge commons will empower citizens and enable fair and sustainable societies. We aim to achieve this not only within the Belgian borders but inspire and get inspired by communities all over the world. We keep spreading the power of openness, hoping one day Open Knowledge will be the standard.
