The names of public spaces (streets, avenues, squares and others) define the identity of a city and how citizens interact with it. Many cities suffer from a major inequality between male and female street names and we want to help fix this.

There are several ways to approach the inequality of street names and leverage a positive change in our society. Ours is with the use of Open Data to create a map visualizing the street names by gender.
