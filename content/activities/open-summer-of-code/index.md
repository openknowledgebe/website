Open summer of code is an intense summer programme, giving young potential students with development-, communication-, design- and business skills a summer job with a real challenge. Their mission? Transforming open innovation projects into powerful real-world services for real organisations and companies.

The osoc team provides the students with training, network and necessary support. We encourage a setting in which partners, civic technologists, students, coaches and organisers intersect, collaborate and start prototyping the future.

It all started in 2011 when 6 students took on the challenge of iRail Summer of code in Belgium. Its name was changed to open summer of code in 2013. 5 years later, osoc grew its international family for the first time with a Spanish edition. In 2020 the global pandemic forced us to go fully remote.
